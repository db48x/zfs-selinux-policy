I needed ZFS to work on a system with SELinux, and after much
searching I stumbled upon sepolgen. sepolgen accepts as input the name
of an installed program and attemps to create a policy that will allow
it to run correctly under selinux, without stepping on anything
else. It also searches your audit log for denials and creates the
rules needed in order to allow those operations to succeed. Because
the result isn't perfect (for instance, it didn't set a context on the
'zpool' binary), I've gathered it here in case anyone else needs it.

Please help out by letting me know of any refinements or improvements
you may devise. Once I'm sure that there are no major mistakes or
ommissions, I'll get this information checked in to the actual ZFS
repository.
